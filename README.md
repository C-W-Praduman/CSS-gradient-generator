# 🎨 Random Gradient Generator

This is a simple and interactive **Random Gradient Generator** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to generate beautiful linear gradients by clicking two separate buttons – one for each color of the gradient. Every time a button is clicked, the color on one side of the gradient changes and the button label updates with the corresponding HEX code.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 Two buttons to generate random HEX color codes.
- 🌈 Dynamic background gradient updates in real-time.
- 🧾 Color HEX codes appear as the text content of each button.
- 🔁 A separate box displays the live CSS gradient code, which updates instantly with any color change and you can copy the full code by just clicking on it .
- 📋 Perfect for quick CSS color inspiration or for learning purposes.
